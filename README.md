AutoTemp: Multi-Prompt AI Response Analyzer
AutoTemp is a Python tool that generates AI responses for multiple prompts across a range of temperatures using the Groq API, scores them for quality, and produces a detailed HTML report ranking the results.
Features

Tests multiple prompts with various temperatures in parallel.
Scores responses based on relevance, clarity, usefulness, and creativity.
Generates an HTML report with ranked responses, stats, and visualizations.
Displays the model used (e.g., llama3-70b-8192) dynamically in the report.
Opens the report in your default browser (optional).

Prerequisites

Python 3.8+
Groq API Key: Obtain from https://console.groq.com/keys
Dependencies:
groq: For interacting with the Groq API.
Install via pip:pip install groq





Setup

Clone or Download:

Download the autotemp.py script or clone the repository.


Set Up Groq API Key:

Option 1: Add to .env file in the project directory:GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here


Option 2: Set as environment variable:export GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here





Install Dependencies:
pip install groq



Usage
Run the script with Python, specifying prompts, temperatures, and optionally the model or browser behavior.
Basic Command
python autotemp.py


Runs with default prompts and temperatures ([0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9]).
Uses llama3-70b-8192 model by default.
Generates an HTML report and opens it in your browser.

Custom Prompts and Temperatures
Modify the prompts and temperatures lists in autotemp.py:
prompts = [
    "Write a short story about a robot learning to cook.",
    "Create a business plan for a coffee shop during a crisis."
]
temperatures = [0.1, 0.5, 1.0]

Then run:
python autotemp.py

Specify a Different Model
Edit the model in the script or pass it programmatically (if extended). For example:
results, html_file = autotemp_multi_prompt(prompts, temperatures, model="mixtral-8x7b-32768")

Disable Browser Auto-Open
Set open_browser=False:
results, html_file = autotemp_multi_prompt(prompts, temperatures, open_browser=False)

Example Output

The script generates responses, scores them (0-100), and ranks them.
An HTML report (*.html in a temp directory) is created, showing:
Model used (e.g., llama3-70b-8192).
Total prompts, responses, temperatures tested, average best temperature, and success rate.
Per-prompt stats: best temperature, best score, average score, success rate.
Ranked response cards with temperature, score, and content.



Example
python autotemp.py


Tests 2 default prompts with 5 temperatures (10 responses total).
Outputs: âœ… HTML report saved to: /tmp/tmp12345.html
Opens the report in your browser (if open_browser=True).
